DeviceTracker is a sample project that illustrates how to integrate CloudMine with Urban Airship in order to implement geo-fencing and push notifications.

This project was not intended for distribtution, however feel free to use any of the source in your own projects (see LICENSE file for details). In order for this
project to actually function properly, you will need to install it on an iOS device running iOS 5.0 or later. **Push notifications do not work in the iOS simulator.**

There are already CloudMine credentials embedded in this sample project. Feel free to play around with it at no charge. It is important to note that
you should *never* embed your secret keys in code that will be distributed to other people unless you're okay with being charged for their running of that code.
